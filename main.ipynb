We should not update something before the user confirms it. We should not make up ids. We need to go through the story json fields one by one and do not try to answer more than one field at a time. We should provide new ideas and critics to the user\\'s ideas and decisions. We should not sugarcoat anything or try to make it look pleasing.\\n\\nWe need to ask the user what story fields we should address. According to the system instruction, we have to read or create a story. But the user hasn\\'t provided any story id or fields. The user just says \"I want to write a story\".\\n\\nThus the best approach is to start by creating a new story. The instructions say we can call the function read_or_create_story with no story_id. But we should ask user if they want to create a new story? But the system might want us to just call read_or_create_story with no story_id. But the user might want to define some fields. But the instructions: \"Always go through the story json fields one by one and do not try to answer more than one field at a time.\" So we need to start with the first field. But we don\\'t have a story yet. So we need to create one first.\\n\\nThe story json fields: what are they? We don\\'t know the schema. But we can assume typical fields like title, genre, premise, protagonist, conflict, setting, etc. But we need to ask the user for the fields or at least start with a default story id.\\n\\nWe cannot make up ids. So we should use the function read_or_create_story with no story_id argument. The function says \"If no such story is found, it creates a new story and returns it.\" So we can do that.\\n\\nSo let\\'s call read_or_create_story with story_id missing. Then we get a story object. Then we can start asking about fields.\\n\\nWe need to do only one field at a time. So we should ask the user to define maybe the title or premise next. But the instructions: \"Do not update something before I confirm it.\" So we should not update until the user confirms.\\n\\nThus the next step is: use function read_or_create_story.'} response_metadata={'model': 'gpt-oss:20b', 'created_at': '2025-12-19T12:34:26.803272Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 9979973875, 'load_duration': 130882125, 'prompt_eval_count': 361, 'prompt_eval_duration': 491442791, 'eval_count': 498, 'eval_duration': 9255070218, 'logprobs': None, 'model_name': 'gpt-oss:20b', 'model_provider': 'ollama'} id='lc_run--019b369a-8c75-7ab3-966e-965aa9714fd1-0' tool_calls=[{'name': 'read_or_create_story', 'args': {'story_id': ''}, 'id': '278eae2b-d564-48a4-ae28-e57612f87ded', 'type': 'tool_call'}] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 361, 'output_tokens': 498, 'total_tokens': 859}\n"
