      "| **Science‑Fantasy** | Wide world‑building freedom; can mix tech & magic | Over‑loading exposition; can feel too “fantasy‑ish” if not grounded |\n",

      "| **Romantic Comedy** | Relatable humor, emotional payoff | Can become cliché if not subverting expectations |\n",
      "| **Historical Drama** | Rich setting, opportunity for social commentary | Requires accurate research; can be bogged down in period detail |\n",

      "| Aspect | Strength | Potential Pitfall |\n",
      "|--------|----------|-------------------|\n",
      "| **Sitcom structure** | Easy to script, episode‑by‑episode payoff, audience familiarity | Can feel formulaic if not inventive |\n",
      "| **Satirical lens** | Offers critical commentary on social norms, humor that can subvert expectations | Risk of being perceived as mocking rather than exploring |\n",
      "| **Turkish cultural authenticity** | Opportunity to showcase unique customs, family dynamics, language quirks | Requires solid research to avoid clichés or stereotypes |\n",

      "- **Premise**: A multi‑generational family lives in a single apartment in Istanbul; each member has a different view on modern vs. traditional upbringing.  \n",
      "- **Setting**: Blend the bustling city life with family traditions (e.g., Sunday lunch, weekend visits to a “baba”).  \n",
      "- **Characters**: Grandparent who still uses a rotary phone, a university‑aged tech‑savvy teen, a middle‑aged parent stuck between two cultures, and an over‑enthusiastic relative who thinks everything is a “business opportunity.”  \n",
      "- **Tone**: Quick one‑liners and running gags (e.g., the “şeyh’s advice” segment), but moments that touch on real issues (parent‑child conflict, generational gap, socioeconomic pressures).\n",
      "\n",
      "**What to watch out for**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Stereotyping**: Avoid painting all Turks with the same brush. Show diverse backgrounds—urban, rural, different socioeconomic levels, and varied religious practices.  \n",
      "- **Satire overload**: Too much sarcasm can alienate viewers who might otherwise relate to the situations. Balance is key.  \n",
      "- **Cultural nuance**: Small details (how you say “good morning,” the way a family gathers for “kahve”) matter. If you’re not from that background, involve a cultural consultant or do in‑depth research.\n",

      "| **3** | **The “Kahve & Secrets” Game** | The family gathers for their weekly “kahve” (coffee) session. The grandma proposes a game: each person whispers a secret about a “secret crush.” The youngest, bored, invents a fake secret that turns out to be true. | The grandma, thinking she’s unearthing a scandal, threatens a “family exile” from the coffee table, causing the whole family to improvise a fake exile ritual, complete with dramatic music and over‑the‑top lamentations. |\n",

      "1. **Potential over‑use of the “rebel daughter” trope** – This can feel clichéd if Ayşe’s rebelliousness is only surface‑level. Give her unique quirks (e.g., she’s a meme‑collector or has a peculiar habit of rearranging furniture each week) to make her memorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Risk of reinforcing gender stereotypes** – If Ayşe is portrayed mainly as “trying to get a boyfriend” while the male characters are less emotionally complex, it could come across as one‑dimensional. Consider balancing the love interest with a solid, relatable backstory.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Family dynamics** – The mother‑father dynamic needs to be more than “father wants marriage, mother wants reputation.” Adding humor, such as the father secretly practicing yoga in the basement or the mother being an amateur TikTok creator, can give the family members their own sub‑conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cultural authenticity** – Ensure that Ayşe’s modern lifestyle and the family's old‑school values are not caricatured. Use specific Istanbul details (e.g., a favorite corner café, a local “cafetin” that’s in the family’s tradition) to ground the satire.\n",
