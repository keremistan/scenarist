But instructions say we should not ask for more than one field at a time, but we can ask. But maybe we can interpret: \"Let’s go through fields one by one.\" So we should ask for genre, then for logline, summary, etc.\n",

But we have to adhere to instructions: \"Do not sugarcoat anything or try to make it look pleasing.\" But we can be straightforward.
