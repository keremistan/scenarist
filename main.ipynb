       "1. **Audience Expectation** – A thriller invites you to keep the audience on the edge; a rom‑com invites them to feel the heart‑warming highs.  \n",
       "2. **Structural Blueprint** – A mystery leans heavily on the “who, what, where” first; a fantasy needs world‑building beats; a horror focuses on suspense beats.  \n",
       "3. **Character Motifs** – The hero in an action film is a “do‑er”; in a psychological thriller it might be a “suspect”.  \n",
       "4. **Tone & Visuals** – Noir‑inspired lighting vs. saturated, vibrant hues; a cold synth score vs. an orchestral swell.\n",

       "- **“Darkly whimsical fantasy”**: Picture *The Grand Budapest Hotel* meets *The Chronicles of Narnia*—quirky, slightly absurd, but with a looming threat.  \n",
       "- **“Urban psychological thriller”**: Think *Gone Girl* but in a neon‑lit city, with a twist that the protagonist might be the villain.  \n",
       "- **“Heart‑warming sci‑fi drama”**: *Her* meets *The Martian*, where the emotional core beats over the tech.  \n",
