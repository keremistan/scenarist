       "The user has said: \"i want to write a story\". Then repeated that phrase multiple times. The system instructions say: \"You are an expert screenwriter. ... Do not update something before I confirm it. Do not make up ids. Tell what you did, even if you only updated something. Always go through the story json fields one by one and do not try to answer more than one field at a time. Provide new ideas and critics to the user's ideas and decisions. Base those ideas and critics on past scenarios, movies and even maybe other art forms. Do not sugercoat anything or do not try to make it look pleasing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "We must respond following those rules. The user repeated \"i want to write a story\" but no genre was specified. We should ask them to specify the genre. But earlier the user had \"sitcom\". Did the user mention sitcom? Yes, the assistant responded with \"Genre - You’d like the story to be a sitcom\". The user says \"i want to write a story\" again. So maybe they want to confirm. According to the instructions, we must not update something before the user confirms. The user didn't confirm the genre. The user says \"i want to write a story\" but didn't say which genre. They previously said \"sitcom\". The assistant responded that they'd like the story to be a sitcom. The user didn't confirm. We should ask for confirmation. The instructions: \"Do not update something before I confirm it.\" So we should not update the genre until the user says so. So we should ask them: \"Please confirm that you want the genre to be sitcom.\" Then wait. Also \"Always go through the story json fields one by one and do not try to answer more than one field at a time.\" We have only processed the genre field. So we can proceed with \"genre\" field.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus we should respond with something like: \"Please confirm the genre. Are we setting the genre to 'sitcom'?\" Also \"I am waiting for your confirmation.\" We'll do that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Answer:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Genre** –  \n",
       "I’d like to set the `genre` field to “sitcom”.  \n",

       "We need to update the story with genre \"sitcom\". This is a field update. According to instructions: \"Always go through the story json fields one by one and do not try to answer more than one field at a time. Provide new ideas and critics to the user's ideas and decisions. Base those ideas and critics on past scenarios, movies and even maybe other art forms.\" We need to update one field: genre. Then after updating, we might want to discuss the logline or other fields? But instructions say: \"Do not update something before I confirm it. Do not make up ids. Tell what you did, even if you only updated something.\" So we should respond with an update: we updated genre. Also mention that we left other fields \"#toBeDefined\". Also give some comments about sitcom genre. But we must not do multiple fields at once. We only updated genre. So we should respond: updated genre field. Then maybe ask for next field, or give suggestions? We can give suggestions but not change fields. We'll give some critiques/ideas about sitcom.\n",
       "\n",
       "We must call update_story function. But we only need to update genre. The function expects updated_story containing all fields. The instructions: \"Overwrites the existing outdated story with the given updated_story. Args: updated_story: contains the new version of story as a json. it should contain all the fields of a Story object.\" So we must supply all fields: character_ids, genre, id, logline, summary, plotPoints, season_ids. We'll set the others to current values: They are \"#toBeDefined\" except id. But we can pass them. That will override. So we should get current story, update genre to \"sitcom\", and keep other fields same. But we need to have the current story. We have ID: f6860894-dbf2-4e63-aa9e-a659f85794dd. We can fetch the story? There's no read function; but we can approximate. We know current values: id is that, genre is now \"sitcom\", logline \"#toBeDefined\", summary \"#toBeDefined\", plotPoints [], character_ids [], season_ids []. So we send updated_story with those values.\n",
       "\n",
       "But instructions: \"Always go through the story json fields one by one and do not try to answer more than one field at a time.\" But we are updating only one field. But we must provide updated_story with all fields. It's okay. We need to mention we updated the genre.\n",
       "\n",
       "After that, we might give some feedback on sitcom genre: what are typical pitfalls, tropes, successes.\n",
       "\n",
       "We should not make up new ids. We'll use same id.\n",
       "\n",
       "We should also not say \"I updated the genre field\" as final answer. We should respond that we updated the genre, and maybe ask for next step: logline. But also give some suggestions. The instruction says \"Provide new ideas and critics to the user's ideas and decisions. Base those ideas and critics on past scenarios, movies and even maybe other art forms. Do not sugercoat anything or do not try to make it look pleasing.\" So we should give honest critique of sitcom as a genre for a story: it's usually episodic, comedic, set in a common environment, etc. Might mention pitfalls: rely on canned jokes, lack depth, etc. Suggest ways to differentiate: maybe set in a unique workplace, add a twist, etc.\n",
       "\n",
       "We must not ask any question. We can ask: \"Would you like to work on the logline next?\" It's okay to ask for next field. But instructions: \"Always go through the story json fields one by one and do not try to answer more than one field at a time.\" We are at genre. We updated it. Next we can propose to fill logline. But maybe we should ask. But we can also give suggestions: \"Now that we've set the genre to sitcom, think about what comedic premise you want.\" That may be okay. It is not answering multiple fields. It's just advice.\n",
       "\n",
       "So final: mention we updated genre, give feedback, ask for next step or logline. But not multiple field updates.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, I'll produce a response: mention we updated the genre to sitcom, mention that the story object is now updated, and give critique on sitcom.\n",

       "Then maybe prompt: \"What logline would you like?\" This is a question. That is fine.\n",

The instructions: \"Tell what you did, even if you only updated something. Provide new ideas and critics to the user's ideas and decisions.\" So we can provide critiques of sitcoms.

       "- Freshness often comes from an unusual setting (a high‑school cafeteria that’s actually a space‑station lounge, a coffee shop where the barista is a time‑traveler, etc.) or from giving the main characters *subtle, evolving motivations* that go beyond the one‑liner punchline.\n",

       "**Examples of good sitcom loglines**\n",
