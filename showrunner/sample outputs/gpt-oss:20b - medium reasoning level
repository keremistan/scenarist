Character: Ahmet faces challenges when communicating with others, including his friends, colleagues and lovers. He is not taught be an adult and cannot handle adult life. Tone: light, meaningful, yet funny.\n\nWe need to write an introductory scene. Likely setting: some typical everyday scenario. Maybe Ahmet is in a family dinner, or at office. He tries to communicate but fails, comedic but meaningful.\n\nWe should incorporate kids being taught respect. Could be Ahmet is a kid? Actually "Ahmet faces challenges... He is not taught be an adult." He could be a child? But "he cannot handle adult life" suggests he\'s a young adult? Maybe he\'s a teenager. The theme: kids must be taught that they deserve respect so they can be mature later. So we could show Ahmet interacting with his parents, friends, colleagues. Show his communication difficulties, but we also show him learning something about respect. Also comedic elements.\n\nWe can write in a sitcom style: opening line, cut to set, voiceover, etc.\n\nWe may also want to include some comedic misunderstandings. Perhaps Ahmet has a job at a coffee shop, and he miscommunicates orders.\n\nMaybe we could incorporate a comedic "respect chain" where kids treat parents with respect.\n\nWe can show him at a party, his mother is upset that he didn\'t ask permission to bring friends, etc.\n\nWe need to set up the character: Ahmet\'s personality: he\'s naive, well-meaning but not taught to be an adult. He has trouble communicating. He thinks he deserves respect but doesn\'t understand how to show respect. The humor comes from his attempts and misinterpretations.\n\nWe should open with an establishing shot: "Ahmet\'s apartment, messy." Then maybe his phone rings. The theme: kids must be taught that they deserve respect. Maybe his mother is giving him a pep talk.\n\nLet\'s outline: opening: Ahmet wakes up, he has a job at a coffee shop. He goes to work, misinterprets orders, jokes. He also is trying to impress his crush. The scene ends with a comedic but meaningful message about respect, maybe with his mom giving advice.\n\nLet\'s write in a comedic script format, with stage directions.\n\nWe\'ll incorporate the theme subtly: perhaps his mom says "You deserve respect, Ahmet, but you have to show it back to others." The comedic line: "I want to be a boss."\n\nOk, let\'s write. We\'ll keep tone light, meaningful, funny.\n\nWe\'ll incorporate the guidelines: theme, genre, characters, tone.\n\nWe\'ll include "kids must be taught that they deserve respect" as a line.\n\nAlso maybe we can show the show tagline.\n\nLet\'s write scene in script format.\n\nWe\'ll have characters: Ahmet, Fatma (his mother), Leyla (his crush), Hakan (colleague), and maybe a regular customer.\n\nWe\'ll write in a sitcom style.\n\nOk.'}, response_metadata={'model': 'gpt-oss:20b', 'created_at': '2025-12-25T16:22:05.272804Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 38200965291, 'load_duration': 3390025208, 'prompt_eval_count': 273, 'prompt_eval_duration': 459754709, 'eval_count': 1823, 'eval_duration': 33942915224, 'logprobs': None, 'model_name': 'gpt-oss:20b', 'model_provider': 'ollama'}, id='lc_run--019b5650-af9e-72c2-95a7-7fa0f7d75d31-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 273, 'output_tokens': 1823, 'total_tokens': 2096})]}
