AHMET’S APARTMENT – MORNING**\n\nA tiny, over-decorated studio that screams *“I tried to be an adult on a budget.”* Motivational posters. An unopened ironing board still in plastic. A fancy mug that says **WORLD’S BEST PROFESSIONAL**.\n\nAHMET (late 20s/early 30s), earnest and slightly panicked at baseline, stands in front of a mirror in a dress shirt… with the tag still dangling.\n\nHe clears his throat like he’s about to give a TED Talk to the mirror.\n\n**AHMET**  \nGood morning, Ahmet. You are a man. You are calm. You are—  \n(tries a smile)  \n—approachable.\n\nHis phone BUZZES. A calendar notification pops up:\n\n**“TEAM STANDUP – 9:00 AM – SAY ONE NORMAL SENTENCE.”**\n\nAhmet winces.\n\nHe opens his Notes app. A list titled: **ADULT THINGS TO SAY OUT LOUD**.\n\nHe scrolls through entries like:  \n- *“Sounds good.”*  \n- *“No worries!”*  \n- *“I can take that.”*  \n- *“Thanks for your patience.”*  \n- *“I deserve respect.”* (highlighted, underlined, starred)\n\nHe taps the last one and practices.\n\n**AHMET**  \nI deserve respect.  \n(too aggressive)  \nI DESERVE RESPECT.  \n(too pleading)  \nI… deserve… respect?  \n\nHe stops. Sighs. Tries again—soft, normal.\n\n**AHMET**  \nI deserve respect.\n\nA BEAT. He nods, like he just unlocked adulthood.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n**INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER**\n\nAhmet steps out, locking his door with the focus of someone diffusing a bomb.\n\nHis neighbor, MRS. PERI (60s, warm but blunt), is in the hall holding a garbage bag. She’s the kind of person who can compliment you and destroy you in the same sentence.\n\n**MRS. PERI**  \nAhmet! Good morning. You’re wearing a nice shirt.\n\nAhmet brightens.\n\n**AHMET**  \nThank you! I am a professional now.\n\nMrs. Peri points to his chest. The tag. Still there.\n\n**MRS. PERI**  \nYou’re also… a mannequin.\n\nAhmet looks down. Freezes. Then reacts like he’s been publicly arrested.\n\n**AHMET**  \nNo— I— It’s— It’s fashion. It’s— ventilation.\n\nHe starts to rip the tag off. It won’t tear. He tugs harder.\n\nIt RIPS LOUDLY—taking a tiny piece of the shirt with it.\n\nHe holds the shredded tag like evidence in a trial.\n\n**MRS. PERI**  \nIf it makes you feel better, my son once went to a wedding with the security sticker still on his pants.\n\nAhmet attempts a laugh. It comes out as a short, stressed cough.\n\n**AHMET**  \nThat’s… comforting. In a tragic way.\n\nMrs. Peri studies him for a moment—kind, perceptive.\n\n**MRS. PERI**  \nYou look nervous. First day?\n\n**AHMET**  \nNo, no. It’s my…  \n(quickly checks phone)  \n…four hundredth day. But every day feels like the first day because nobody trained me. Like… emotionally.\n\nMrs. Peri nods like she’s heard this exact sentence from men across generations.\n\n**MRS. PERI**  \nListen to me. When someone talks to you like you’re small, you don’t shrink. You stand. You speak. You say, “I don’t like that.”\n\nAhmet absorbs this like it’s a sacred spell.\n\n**AHMET**  \nI don’t like that.\n\n**MRS. PERI**  \nGood. And you say it without apologizing.\n\nAhmet tries again, confident.\n\n**AHMET**  \nI don’t like that.  \n(then immediately)  \nSorry.\n\nMrs. Peri points at him—*caught you.*\n\n**MRS. PERI**  \nAhmet.\n\n**AHMET**  \nRight. Sorry—  \n(stops himself)  \n—Not sorry. I mean— I am sorry that I’m not sorry— No, wait—\n\nThe ELEVATOR DINGS. Doors open. Inside is KEREM (30s), Ahmet’s friend, effortlessly adult-looking, holding a travel coffee and the calm of someone who can return items without fear.\n\n**KEREM**  \nMorning. Why are you yelling “not sorry” in the hallway like a politician?\n\nAhmet steps into the elevator, flustered.\n\n**AHMET**  \nI’m practicing boundaries.\n\nKerem takes a sip.\n\n**KEREM**  \nAt 8:59 a.m.? Beautiful. Unhinged.\n\nMrs. Peri leans in before the elevator closes.\n\n**MRS. PERI**  \nRemember: you deserve respect.\n\nAhmet nods solemnly, like he’s receiving a blessing.\n\n**AHMET**  \nI deserve respect.\n\nThe elevator doors start to CLOSE—\n\nAhmet panics and blurts to Mrs. Peri, too loud:\n\n**AHMET (CONT’D)**  \nAND YOU TOO!\n\nDoors shut.\n\nInside the elevator, Kerem stares.\n\n**KEREM**  \nOkay. Who hurt you before breakfast?\n\nAhmet exhales, presses the “L” button like it owes him money.\n\n**AHMET**  \nEveryone. Quietly. For years.\n\nKerem nods, dead serious.\n\n**KEREM**  \nYeah. That tracks.\n\nThey ride down in silence.\n\nAhmet checks his Notes again. Scrolls. Lands on a line:\n\n**“WHEN YOU WANT TO CRY, SAY ‘CIRCLING BACK.’”**\n\nAhmet whispers it like a prayer.\n\n**AHMET**  \nCircling back.\n\nKerem glances over.\n\n**KEREM**  \nTo what?\n\nAhmet looks up, wide-eyed—realizing he has no idea.\n\n**AHMET**  \n…Exactly.\n\nSMASH CUT TO TITLE.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1277, 'prompt_tokens': 824, 'total_tokens': 2101, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-5.2-2025-12-11', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-CqidWqiarbsbil1mIVPg2prllwLJU', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b565f-bc71-7542-97b0-f18550b6f1c6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 824, 'output_tokens': 1277, 'total_tokens': 2101, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]}
