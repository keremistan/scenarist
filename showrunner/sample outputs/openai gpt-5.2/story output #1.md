--- LOGICAL PLAN ---
1. **Story arc:** Ahmet tries to make a romantic confession to someone he likes, but his poor “adult communication” skills turn it into a painfully awkward spiral. The other person doesn’t crush him, but forces a healthier conversation: *respect isn’t something you earn by guessing correctly; it’s something you deserve enough to ask for directly.*
2. **Characters:**  
   - **Ahmet:** well-meaning, anxious, emotionally under-taught; uses jokes, over-explaining, and self-insults to avoid the scary part (being clear).  
   - **Zeynep:** the love interest; calm, witty, emotionally literate; she moves the story forward by not letting Ahmet disrespect himself for laughs.  
   - **Mert (friend):** acts as a pressure valve with sitcom interruptions and terrible advice; highlights Ahmet’s immaturity and fear of rejection.
3. **Location:** **A cramped apartment building stairwell + landing by the neighbor’s door.** It’s a liminal, public-but-private place that amplifies discomfort (echoes, interruptions, nowhere to “escape”), perfect for an awkward confession and comedic timing (neighbor door, passing footsteps).

--- STYLE PLAN ---
1. **Pacing Analysis:** Fast, back-and-forth sitcom banter with short beats; sudden pauses where the pain lands; quick interruptions (door, footsteps, phone) that spike the cringe.
2. **Subtext Strategy:** Ahmet hides vulnerability through babbling, disclaimers, and self-deprecation (“I’m dumb,” “ignore me”). Zeynep hides her tenderness behind dry humor, but gets direct when she sees him shrinking himself.
3. **Vocabulary Rules:** Modern conversational dialogue; avoid poetic monologues. Use: interruptions, half-sentences, “No, I mean—”, clarifying questions, awkward specifics. Keep it light but let a few lines land plainly (respect, boundaries, asking).

--- SCENE START ---

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT

A narrow stairwell. Fluorescent light. Every sound echoes a little too much.

AHMET and ZEYNEP stand on the landing outside her door. Zeynep’s keys are in her hand. Ahmet is blocking absolutely nothing, yet somehow blocking everything.

ZEYNEP  
So… you walked me home like a Victorian novelist.

AHMET  
Yes. Exactly. I’m like… “Sir Ahmet.” With— with anxiety instead of a horse.

Zeynep smiles, patient.

ZEYNEP  
You okay?

Ahmet nods too hard.

AHMET  
I’m great. I’m normal. I’m a normal man in a stairwell. This is what adults do. They stand. Near doors.

A BEAT. Zeynep waits. Ahmet inhales, exhales, inhales again like he’s trying to start a lawnmower with his lungs.

ZEYNEP  
Ahmet.

AHMET  
Yeah. Yep. So. I just wanted to say, before you go inside and… lock your door because I’m being weird—

ZEYNEP  
I’m not locking my door because you’re weird. I lock it because my neighbor sells “authentic” perfumes.

From behind the next door, faintly:

NEIGHBOR (O.S.)  
They’re ORIGINAL!

Ahmet flinches like he’s been caught stealing.

AHMET  
Okay! Great! Love a community.

Zeynep tilts her head.

ZEYNEP  
What’s going on?

Ahmet laughs. It’s the laugh of a man trying to pay off a debt with Monopoly money.

AHMET  
Nothing. It’s nothing. It’s just a— a sentence I have in my body. Like a splinter. And if I don’t say it, I’ll get infected and die and that’s dramatic but also accurate.

ZEYNEP  
Okay. Say the sentence.

Ahmet points at her keys.

AHMET  
Your keys are… very key-like.

ZEYNEP  
That’s not a sentence. That’s a hostage situation.

Ahmet squeezes his eyes shut.

AHMET  
Okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. I’m— I’m not good at… the grown-up version of talking. My family taught me how to pay bills and emotionally disappear.

ZEYNEP  
Mm. Relatable.

Ahmet looks at the stairwell like it might provide subtitles.

AHMET  
I like you.

Zeynep softens. Quiet.

ZEYNEP  
Okay.

Ahmet immediately panics at the “okay.”

AHMET  
No but like— not “I like you” like I like soup. Because soup is seasonal. And you’re— you’re not seasonal. You’re— you’re… a year-round concept.

ZEYNEP  
Ahmet—

AHMET  
And I know I’m not— I’m not smooth. I’m not a smooth person. I’m more like… sandpaper. But emotionally. Like if emotions were wood.

ZEYNEP  
Stop hurting yourself for comedic effect.

That lands. Ahmet’s smile falters.

AHMET  
I’m not hurting myself. I’m just… being accurate so you don’t have to.

ZEYNEP  
I didn’t ask you to do that.

Ahmet swallows. The stairwell hum fills the pause.

ZEYNEP (CONT’D)  
You said you like me. Do you mean you want to go on a real date?

Ahmet’s eyes widen, as if she just asked him to disarm a bomb.

AHMET  
A real date? Like… chairs? With a time? And a— a mutual understanding?

ZEYNEP  
Yes. And you don’t have to audition for basic respect while you’re there.

Ahmet tries to joke, but it comes out thin.

AHMET  
I wasn’t auditioning. I was… pre-rejecting myself.

ZEYNEP  
Why?

Ahmet shrugs, but it’s defensive.

AHMET  
Because then it hurts less.

ZEYNEP  
Does it?

A BEAT. Ahmet’s eyes sting, which annoys him.

AHMET  
It hurts… in advance. Which is efficient.

ZEYNEP  
That’s not efficiency. That’s self-bullying with a calendar.

Ahmet laughs once, then stops because it’s too true.

ZEYNEP (CONT’D)  
Listen. I like you too.

Ahmet freezes.

AHMET  
No you don’t.

ZEYNEP  
I do.

AHMET  
That can’t be right, because— because if you like me, then I have to… act like someone who deserves that.

Zeynep steps closer, gentler but firm.

ZEYNEP  
You do deserve it. That’s the point.

Ahmet looks away, embarrassed by how simple that sounds.

A DOOR OPENS downstairs. Footsteps. MERT appears, climbing, holding a plastic bag of chips like it’s an emergency medical kit.

MERT  
Ahmet! Bro! I texted you “DON’T DO IT” like forty times.

He sees Zeynep. He switches instantly to charm mode and fails.

MERT (CONT’D)  
Zeynep. Hello. Nice stairwell.

ZEYNEP  
Hi, Mert.

MERT  
(to Ahmet, urgent whisper)  
Okay, what did you say? Please tell me you didn’t say “I like you” like a child offering a rock.

AHMET  
I said “I like you” like an adult offering… emotional sandpaper.

MERT winces.

MERT  
Oh my God.

ZEYNEP  
We’re fine.

MERT  
Are we though? Because I can feel the cringe from the third floor.

From behind the “original perfume” door:

NEIGHBOR (O.S.)  
Some people have no SHAME!

Zeynep calls out without turning.

ZEYNEP  
Oliver, go back to your fraud.

NEIGHBOR (O.S.)  
It’s entrepreneurship!

Ahmet covers his face with one hand.

AHMET  
This is my worst moment in public. And I’ve eaten corn on the bus.

MERT  
Okay, okay. I’ll fix it.  
(to Zeynep)  
Zeynep, my friend is… emotionally illiterate. Like he can read words, but feelings? No.

AHMET  
Thank you, Mert. Very romantic.

ZEYNEP  
I don’t need you to fix it.  
(to Ahmet)  
Do you want to go out with me? Yes or no.

Ahmet lowers his hand. Looks at her. No escape routes.

AHMET  
Yes.

Zeynep nods, like that’s all she wanted.

ZEYNEP  
Good. Friday?

Ahmet blinks.

AHMET  
Friday is… a day. Yes.

MERT exhales dramatically like a man released from prison.

MERT  
He did it. He answered a question. Growth.

Zeynep starts unlocking her door, then pauses.

ZEYNEP  
One more thing.

Ahmet tenses again.

ZEYNEP (CONT’D)  
When you get scared, you start making yourself small. Jokes, insults, whatever.  
(beat)  
Don’t do that with me.

Ahmet nods, chastened.

AHMET  
Okay.

Then, unable to resist, he adds:

AHMET (CONT’D)  
But if I accidentally do it, can you— like— throw water on me or something?

Zeynep smiles.

ZEYNEP  
I’ll just tell you. Like I did now.

Ahmet absorbs that, quietly moved.

AHMET  
Okay. That’s… better than water.

She slips inside, then looks back.

ZEYNEP  
Goodnight, Ahmet.

AHMET  
Goodnight.

The door closes.

Ahmet stands there, dazed.

MERT  
(to Ahmet)  
So. You’re dating.

AHMET  
I think so.

MERT  
How do you feel?

Ahmet considers. For once, no joke arrives fast enough.

AHMET  
Like… I’m allowed to be here.

Mert’s face softens, then he ruins it immediately.

MERT  
Disgusting. Come on, let’s go before you start journaling in the stairwell.

They head down.

Behind the “original perfume” door:

NEIGHBOR (O.S.)  
If you want DATE perfume, I have DATE perfume!

Ahmet and Mert groan in perfect harmony as they exit.

FADE OUT.
