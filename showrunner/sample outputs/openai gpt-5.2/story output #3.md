--- LOGICAL PLAN ---
1. **Story arc:** Ahmet tries to act “adult” at work by running a small training session, but his shaky communication turns it into a comedy of misunderstandings. An unexpected twist (HR complaint + surprise appearance by his strict dad) raises the stakes: Ahmet could lose his job, and he’s forced to confront the theme—kids must be taught they deserve respect, or they grow up unable to demand it or give it.
2. **Characters:**  
   - **Ahmet:** well-meaning, conflict-avoidant, desperate to be taken seriously; misreads signals and over-apologizes.  
   - **Selin (colleague):** competent, blunt but fair; tries to coach Ahmet toward respectful boundaries.  
   - **Mert (colleague):** jokey instigator; “teases” Ahmet in a way that crosses lines.  
   - **Nihal (HR):** calm, terrifyingly polite; speaks in corporate softness with real consequences.  
   - **Ahmet’s Dad (Kamil):** old-school; thinks “toughening up” is love—unintentionally the root of Ahmet’s issue.
3. **Location:** **Office break room / small meeting nook.** Public enough that embarrassment is amplified (sitcom energy), but still workplace-realistic so HR stakes feel immediate. The space is relevant because it’s where “respect” is performed socially—who gets interrupted, who gets mocked, who gets heard.

--- STYLE PLAN ---
1. **Pacing Analysis:** Fast sitcom rhythm—short lines, quick interruptions, escalating beats. A sharp mid-scene pivot where the tone tightens (HR enters / complaint revealed), then returns to funny with meaningful undercurrent.
2. **Subtext Strategy:** Characters say “just joking” and “no big deal” to hide discomfort. Ahmet masks hurt with politeness. Selin uses practical language to hide empathy. Dad frames disrespect as “preparing you for life.”
3. **Vocabulary Rules:** Modern workplace casual. Simple, punchy sentences. HR uses sanitized corporate phrases (“we received feedback,” “creating a safe environment”). Avoid flowery language. Use precise comedic details (cold tea, broken microwave, flimsy chair). No heavy exposition—reveal through dialogue.

--- SCENE START ---

INT. OFFICE BREAK ROOM - DAY

The break room is half kitchenette, half sad meeting space. A COFFEE MACHINE wheezes like it needs therapy. A sign reads: “PLEASE CLEAN MICROWAVE.” No one has.

AHMET stands by a whiteboard that still says “HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SERKAN!” from three months ago. He holds a marker like it might bite him.

SELIN sits at the tiny table with her laptop open, ready to help. MERT leans against the fridge, sipping tea that’s gone cold out of spite.

AHMET
Okay. Um. Thanks for coming to my—
(pauses)
—to my… mini… alignment.

MERT
Mini alignment? Are we aligning our chakras or our KPIs?

SELIN
Just let him do it, Mert.

AHMET
Yes. Thank you. It’s… quick. It’s about communication.

MERT
Oh, you’re the communication guy now?

Ahmet laughs politely. Too politely. Like he’s renting the laugh.

AHMET
No, no. Not “guy.” Just… we can be nicer to each other.

MERT
We are nice.

SELIN
You called him “Wi-Fi Ahmet” for two weeks because he buffered on a sentence.

MERT
That’s branding.

Ahmet lifts the marker, gathers courage.

AHMET
So. Point one. When someone is speaking, we don’t—

MERT
(interrupting)
—Interrupt?

Ahmet freezes, marker mid-air.

AHMET
Yes. Exactly. That.

MERT
Great training. I feel developed.

Selin shoots Mert a look: stop. Mert smiles like he’s never met consequences.

AHMET
Also… jokes. Jokes are okay. But like… respectful jokes.

MERT
Define respectful. Because my jokes are like… artisanal. Small batch.

AHMET
Maybe… if someone says they don’t like it, we stop.

Beat.

MERT
But you never say you don’t like it.

Ahmet opens his mouth, closes it. He nods as if Mert made a helpful point.

SELIN
That’s the problem, Ahmet.

AHMET
No, it’s okay. I just—
(tries again)
I want to be adult.

MERT
You want to *be* adult?

AHMET
Yes. Like… handle things.

MERT
Okay, Adult Ahmet. Handle this.
(leans in)
Do we still have to pretend your “project timeline” isn’t just you moving sticky notes around until you feel calm?

Ahmet’s face tightens. He forces a smile that looks stapled on.

AHMET
It does calm me. Sticky notes are—
(soft)
—organized.

MERT
See? I knew it. It’s therapy.

SELIN
Mert, you’re doing the exact thing he’s talking about.

MERT
I’m engaging. This is engagement.

Ahmet writes on the whiteboard: “RESPECT.” The marker squeaks like it’s complaining too.

AHMET
Respect. It’s important. Because if you… if you grow up and nobody respects you—

MERT
Then you become a manager.

Selin snorts despite herself. Ahmet tries not to laugh, fails, then looks sad that he laughed.

AHMET
No. You become… someone who thinks they don’t deserve respect.

A half-second of sincerity. It lands.

Selin’s expression softens. Mert’s grin falters—just a hair.

Then the BREAK ROOM DOOR opens.

NIHAL from HR enters, holding a thin folder like it weighs ten kilos. Behind her, carrying a plastic bag of pastries and wearing a too-proud smile—

KAMIL. Ahmet’s father.

Ahmet’s soul exits his body, checks the schedule, and doesn’t come back.

AHMET
Baba?

KAMIL
Surprise! I was near.
(looks around)
This is your office? Cute. Like a dentist.

Mert’s eyes widen with delighted chaos.

MERT
Wait, is this… Adult Ahmet’s dad?

SELIN
Mert.

Nihal smiles the way a printer smiles before it jams.

NIHAL
Hi everyone. Sorry to interrupt.
(beat)
Ahmet, do you have a moment?

AHMET
I… I’m having a moment right now, yes.

NIHAL
We received some feedback regarding your interaction style in the workplace.

Ahmet points at the whiteboard like it’s a lawyer.

AHMET
I’m literally doing respect.

NIHAL
Yes. That’s… good to hear.
(opens folder)
The feedback is that you made a colleague feel “singled out” and “controlled” by calling a meeting about their behavior.

Mert inhales, offended on behalf of his own ego.

MERT
Controlled? I’m free-range.

Selin turns to Mert, low.

SELIN
Did you complain?

MERT
No!
(then)
I mean… I may have said “if Ahmet writes RESPECT in all caps, I’ll sue.”

NIHAL
We also received a message from Facilities.

Ahmet blinks.

AHMET
Facilities?

NIHAL
The microwave door was slammed repeatedly during a “respect demonstration.”

All eyes go to Mert.

MERT
That was… a practical example.

Ahmet’s jaw drops.

AHMET
You slammed the microwave? For my respect?

MERT
To show you what disrespect sounds like. It’s immersive learning.

Kamil laughs loudly, proud of something unclear.

KAMIL
This one is clever! He’s making you strong.

Selin’s eyes flick to Ahmet: here it is.

NIHAL
Additionally—
(looks at Ahmet’s dad, recalculates)
—Ahmet, you have a guest.

KAMIL
I brought börek. For your colleagues. So they like you.
(to Mert)
Eat. Respect comes from stomach.

Ahmet’s face goes red. He speaks carefully, like stepping on glass.

AHMET
Baba, why are you here?

KAMIL
You said you have problem with people. I come. I fix.
(pats Ahmet’s shoulder, a little too hard)
When I was your age, if someone jokes, you joke back. If someone steps on you, you step on them.
(smiles)
Simple.

Ahmet swallows. His voice comes out small.

AHMET
I don’t know how.

Kamil waves it off.

KAMIL
Then learn. Life doesn’t respect you. You take it.

Selin closes her laptop slowly, like she’s putting away a weapon.

SELIN
Or… someone teaches you that you deserve it.

Kamil turns, surprised. He wasn’t expecting the office to have opinions.

KAMIL
Deserve? Nobody deserves anything. You earn.

SELIN
You earn promotions. You don’t earn basic respect.

Nihal clears her throat—gentle, lethal.

NIHAL
Just to clarify: at this company, respect is not optional, it’s policy.

Mert raises a hand.

MERT
So… we’re respecting now because it’s in a PDF?

NIHAL
Yes, Mert. Among other reasons.

Mert lowers his hand, chastened for the first time in recorded history.

Ahmet looks between them—HR, Selin, Mert, his father. Stakes stack up in his eyes.

AHMET
So what happens? Am I… in trouble?

Nihal gives him the corporate hug of doom.

NIHAL
This is not disciplinary at this time. It is… a conversation.
(beat)
But the colleague who reported felt that you “weaponized politeness.”

Ahmet blinks hard.

AHMET
Weaponized… politeness?

MERT
That’s kind of impressive, actually.

SELIN
Mert.

Ahmet’s voice wobbles.

AHMET
I wasn’t weaponizing. I was… surviving.

Silence. Even the coffee machine seems to stop wheezing to listen.

Kamil shifts, uncomfortable. He doesn’t like feelings unless they’re on TV.

KAMIL
Ahmet, don’t be dramatic.

Ahmet looks at his dad—really looks. Then, for the first time, he doesn’t apologize before speaking.

AHMET
Baba, when you say things like that… I feel small.

Kamil’s face tightens—defensive, then confused, then something softer he doesn’t have a name for.

KAMIL
I— I made you strong.

AHMET
No. You made me quiet.

Selin exhales, like she’s been waiting years to hear that sentence from someone.

Nihal, still HR-professional, nods as if she’s ticking a box labeled “breakthrough.”

NIHAL
This is… a productive direction.

Mert looks genuinely guilty, which makes him look sick.

MERT
Ahmet, I thought you were okay with it because you smiled.

AHMET
I smile when I’m not okay. That’s my whole personality.

Selin can’t help it—she laughs. A short, surprised laugh. Ahmet almost smiles too, but stays steady.

AHMET (CONT’D)
If you make a joke and I say stop… you stop.

MERT
Okay.
(beat)
If you say stop, I stop.

NIHAL
Great. That’s actually… the entire training.

Kamil points at the whiteboard, trying to recover control.

KAMIL
Respect.
(grumbles)
Fine. Everyone respect him. Happy?

Ahmet meets his dad’s eyes.

AHMET
Not “everyone.” You.

Kamil opens his mouth. No sound comes out. He sets the börek down like it’s suddenly heavy.

KAMIL
I… respect you.

It comes out clunky. Like a foreign word.

Ahmet nods. It’s not perfect, but it’s real.

NIHAL
Wonderful. I’ll note this as “immediate corrective action via family intervention.”
(smiles)
Very innovative.

Mert leans toward Selin, whispering.

MERT
Are we allowed to put “family intervention” on our OKRs?

SELIN
If you do, I’ll weaponize a stapler.

Ahmet caps the marker with a quiet click—like closing a chapter.

AHMET
So… can we eat börek respectfully?

Mert grabs a piece with both hands, solemn.

MERT
With honor.

They start eating. The tension loosens, but the lesson stays, sitting on the table with the crumbs.

Kamil watches Ahmet—like he’s seeing him for the first time in a place that isn’t childhood.

KAMIL
(next to Ahmet, low)
You… really felt small?

AHMET
All the time.

Kamil nods once, stiff.

KAMIL
Okay.
(beat)
We… learn.

Ahmet looks at him, surprised by the “we.”

SELIN
(to Nihal)
So we’re good?

NIHAL
For now. But please stop slamming appliances in the name of emotional growth.

MERT
So… the toaster is off-limits too?

NIHAL
Especially the toaster.

CUT TO Ahmet, chewing börek, trying not to cry, succeeding—barely—by choosing to laugh instead.

AHMET
Adult life is… very loud.

MERT
That’s why we have microwaves.

Selin throws a napkin at Mert. It hits him perfectly.

Ahmet laughs—this time, it’s not rented.

FADE OUT.
