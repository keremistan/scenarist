**INT. COMMUNITY CENTER – AFTER SCHOOL – DAY**

*A brightly lit, slightly cluttered room. Kids in school uniforms sit in a semi‑circle. A banner reads **“RESPECT CLUB – LET’S RESPECT EACH OTHER.”** A whiteboard reads “Rule 1: Respect Everyone, Especially the Teachers.” A large clock shows **3:00 PM**.*

**AHMET** (late 20s, slightly disheveled, clutching a stack of papers) stands nervously in front of a battered microphone. A name tag reads **“Ahmet – Club Officer.”**

**Kids** (LILA 12, MAX 10, SAM 9, JESSICA 11) chatter, whispering excitedly among themselves. The room hums with teenage curiosity.

**AHMET**  
*(attempts a bright, enthusiastic tone; the mic squeaks)*  
Welcome, kids! I’m Ahmet, your new… uh… club officer. Today we’re talking about the importance of—  
*(He fumbles the word “respect” and accidentally says “re‑pspect.”)*  
...respect! Remember, no shouting, no ignoring, and—  
*(He looks down at his papers, then back up, trying to keep his voice steady.)*  
Rule number one: we always, always—  
*(He pauses, scratching his head, then blinks at the whiteboard.)*  
Rule one: Respect everyone, especially the teachers.

*The kids giggle. Lila leans over to Max.*

**LILA**  
*(whispering)*  
Did he just say “re‑pspect”?

**MAX**  
*(trying to focus)*  
He’s saying respect. That’s fine.

*Ahmet, oblivious, grabs a small rubber ball that has fallen on the floor. He holds it up like a microphone.*

**AHMET**  
*(in a deeper voice, looking at the ball)*  
Okay, kids! I want you to—  
*(He gestures at the kids, then at the ball, as if the ball will answer.)*  
You are like… like the balls in my hands.  
*(The kids burst into laughter.)*

**MAX**  
*(to Ahmet, deadpan)*  
We’re not balls.

**AHMET**  
*(puzzled)*  
Right! But… you all… you all are balls.  
*(He stares at the ball, then at the kids, trying to understand.)*  

*He reaches for the ball again.*

**AHMET**  
*(whispering)*  
Can I ask you a question?

*The ball stays silent. Ahmet flings it into the air and it pops comically. The kids laugh harder.*

**AHMET**  
*(louder, trying to keep the mood light)*  
Who wants to help me?  
*(He holds the ball up like a spotlight, expecting a response.)*  
Who?

*The kids erupt into giggles. Ahmet freezes. He sees the whiteboard’s new scribble: “Rule 2: Ask for help if you don’t understand.” He glances at it, a sudden look of panic crossing his face.*

**JESSICA**  
*(tentatively)*  
Um… I think we… can… help you, Ahmet.

**AHMET**  
*(relief flickers in his eyes)*  
Yes! Great! So let’s do this: I want you to… to… to… do the “respect dance.”  
*(He pulls out a CD from his backpack. The cover reads “Kazoo Beats.” He presses play. A kazoo track starts, but it’s playing at a squeaky, half‑speed tempo. He launches into an awkward, half‑step dance, the kids watching, bemused.)*

*Sam, curious, starts a goofy dance of his own. Max copies him, Lila mimics Sam, and Jessica does an earnest clapping routine.*

**SAM**  
*(calling out)*  
That’s actually a nice move. Maybe… maybe you just… just need to…  

*Ahmet freezes, looking at Sam, then at the kids. He seems to realize he’s out of his depth.*

**AHMET**  
*(stammering, but sincere)*  
Sorry. I… I’m new. I think I just… I don’t… I don’t know how to… talk to you all properly. I’m… I’m not a grown man… I need you to… teach me.

*The kids exchange glances, then Lila puts a gentle hand on his shoulder.*

**LILA**  
*(softly)*  
We’re all adults in our own way. We want to be respected. But we also need to respect you. It’s okay if you’re learning.

**AHMET**  
*(relieved)*  
Thank you. Maybe… maybe… let’s try again. This time… let’s ask a question. Max, can you ask?

**MAX**  
*(nervous, but determined)*  
Um… Hey… why is it important to listen?

*Ahmet looks at Max, then at Lila, Sam, and Jessica. A small, genuine smile creeps across his face.*

**AHMET**  
*(sincerely)*  
Good question. Listening helps… well, it helps… it helps us understand each other. And that’s how we respect each other.

*The kids nod, a brief moment of shared understanding. The room falls quiet for a beat—a comedic contrast to the previous chaos.*

**AHMET (V.O.)**  
*(soft, hopeful)*  
So, I guess… if we all try a little, we can learn to respect each other. Especially… especially the kids. They deserve… they deserve respect.

*The camera pulls back, the kids smile, and the laughter subsides into a gentle, appreciative hum.*

**CUT TO:**

*BLACK.*
