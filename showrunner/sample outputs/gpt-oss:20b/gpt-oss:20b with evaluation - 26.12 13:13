**AHMED**  
(embarrassed)  
It’s a… banana hat.  Some kids wear bananas.  It’s, uh, fun.  And respect means you can wear a banana hat too.

*Lisa sighs, then chuckles softly.*

**LISA**  
Ahmed, maybe we can start with the basics: “Treat others how you want to be treated.”  Also, no banana hats in the workshop.

**AHMED**  
(leaning in)  
You want me to say that?  Okay.  “Treat other… uh… people like you like to be… liked.”  Okay, got it.

*Ahmed starts a new line of speech.  He’s flustered, but the kids are amused.  Lisa watches, a smile creasing her face.*

**LISA**  
(to herself, amused)  
Kids deserve respect.  And a bit of humor.  Maybe Ahmed can learn a thing or two.

*CUT TO:*

**EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER – MOMENTS LATER**

*Ahmed steps out onto the sidewalk, clutching the poster like a shield.  He looks up at the sky, breathes in a big, theatrical inhale.*

**AHMED**  
(to himself)  
One day I’ll be a master of respect.  Maybe I’ll even make them all smile… with banana hats.  (whispers)  Or maybe… just maybe.

*The screen fades to black as the audience hears the sound of kids laughing in the distance.  The upbeat theme music kicks in.*

**TITLE CARD**  
*“Respectful Kids, Respectful Ahmed”*
