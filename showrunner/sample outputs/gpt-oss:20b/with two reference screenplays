The kid lies unconscious on a cot, his fingers stuck in a
connect-box wired to an old laptop computer.
Swat team leader starts to pull the kid up off the cot,
but Dex's hand shoots out, stopping him --
DEX
Bad idea.
Dex whips a mini-cell phone from his pocket. Swat leader
turns a confused eye to Tanner.

Pull him off the system before he's
ejected and he goes brain dead.

        INT. HOOLI, GAVIN BELSON'S OFFICE - DAY (D5) 119
Gavin sits at his desk as Jack enters. Nearby, we see a
solemn Hoover, now with ten days of beard growth and bags
under his eyes.
JACK BARKER
You wanted to see me, Skipper?
GAVIN BELSON
I did indeed. Jack, I appreciate
everything you've done in your
position as head of the Hooli/
Endframe Box, but I think the
company's needs are better suited if
I move you elsewhere.
JACK BARKER
Really? Well, I appreciate the vote
of confidence, G.B. I'm flattered,
and frankly a little bit surprised.
GAVIN BELSON
Really? Why would you be surprised?
Can you think of any reason why you
wouldn't deserve a promotion?
Anything at all?
Gavin throws a look to Hoover.
JACK BARKER
Well, I don't want to hurt my arm
patting myself on the back but... off
the top of my head, I guess not!
GAVIN BELSON
I mean, you have always been...
straight with me, right? Straight to
the point?SILICON VALLEY - 401 - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - 2/24/17 35.
JACK BARKER
I sure have.
GAVIN BELSON
And, you always... went out of your
way for me, yes? You always... put me
first? Gone the extra mile?
JACK BARKER
Gosh I sure tried to.
GAVIN BELSON
Did you?
Gavin stares at Jack. Jack appears to be completely
oblivious to any other meaning to what Gavin is saying.
Gavin throws a look at Hoover: Can you believe this?
GAVIN BELSON (cont'd)
Alright, Jack. Professor. Gary in HR
will set you up. Enjoy your new
office.
JACK BARKER
Thank you, sir.
Jack salutes, turns and heads off, Gavin watching him every
step of the way. Hoover nods and scratches his beard.

RUSS HANNEMAN
Fuck, yes I want to talk business.
REVEAL: Richard stands with Russ near his CAR (complete with
billionaire doors). Nearby, scores of parents wait next to
their TESLAS to pick up their kids. People eye Russ warily.
RUSS HANNEMAN (cont'd)
What's the play? Let's fuck this
thing right in the pussy.
(to nearby parents)
What? That's a meme. It's on the

(to Richard)
Back me up here, Richard.
RICHARD
Well, there are good memes and bad

RUSS HANNEMAN
Thanks for meeting me here. My
fucking nanny got another DUI and
lost her license so now I'm stuck
picking up my own kid like an
asshole. So what's up?

RUSS HANNEMAN
Yeah, before you took a hot steaming

RICHARD
Sure. So I was thinking that maybe
you wanted to come on as a follow-on
investor for our current platform.

Yes. The video chat. It's pretty cool

No you don't.
RICHARD
Sorry, what?
RUSS HANNEMAN
No, you don't. You don't like it.
Richard is taken aback.
RUSS HANNEMAN (cont'd)
Richard, I talk people into doing
things they shouldn't do all the
time. Especially pharmacists. So I
know what it looks like. You don't
believe in the product you're
selling.
RICHARD
What? That's crazy. It's a good,
sound business. The tech is great.
And the guys are all really behind
it.
RUSS HANNEMAN
But you're not behind it, Richard. I
can tell. And as much as you want to
be, you're not.
Kids start to stream out of the school and get into assorted
parents' cars.
RUSS HANNEMAN (cont'd)
It's like this Richard: you're trying
to date a woman, and as great as she
may be, the truth is you're gay. And
you can try all the tricks -- you can
draw a mustache on her and fuck her
in the ass -- but deep in your heart
the truth is, you'd really rather be
plowing a dude.
RICHARD
I'm sorry. What dude, exactly?SILICON VALLEY - 401 - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - 2/24/17 19.

It could be any dude as long as you
really want to fuck him: it could be
a twink, a bear, an otter, a circuit
queen, a chub, a pup, a gipster, a
daddy chaser, a leatherman, a
ladyboy, a Donald Duck -- that's a
gay guy that's been kicked out of the

RICHARD
How do you know so many gay things?
RUSS HANNEMAN
My grandfather just came out of the
closet. Beautiful. Very inspiring.
All I'm saying is, if you're spending
all day fucking, shouldn't Pied Piper
be a dude you want to fuck?
Richard nods to a passing family.
RUSS HANNEMAN (cont'd)

have unlimited time and money. You
can build anything in the world with

it? Three, two, one, go!

No, it's not nerdy. I won it at a high
school science fair. Anyway, a few
weeks ago I got it out to look at the
full moon,
RUSS HANNEMAN
Of course you did.
RICHARD
And uh I was thinking wow, they landed
a man up there with the computing
power of a handheld calculator. And
then I thought jeez, there's literally
millions of times more computing power
in my phone, which is just sitting in
my pocket. And then I thought, there's
billions of phones, just sitting
there. So...what if you could harness
all that power into a massive network.
And if you made use of my compression
to make it even smaller and more
efficient to move things around, I
mean, if you did it right, it could
lead to a totally decentralized
version of the current internet, with
no firewalls or tolls, or government
regulations or spying. Information
would be totally free in every sense

Russ checks his WATCH.

(realizes)
Oh, shit. They kicked us out of this

**INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY**

*The hallway buzzes with the sound of lockers slamming, laughter, and a faint, almost ceremonial “Respect Week” marching band tune. A large banner reads: “REVERSE RESPECT WEEK – LET’S SHOW OUR RESPECT!”*

*Enter **AHMET** (24, an earnest but slightly socially awkward substitute teacher), clutching a stack of paper that appears to be a lesson plan. He’s wearing a bright green blazer that’s slightly too large and a name tag that reads “Ahmet, Substitute.”*

**AHMET**  
(whispering to himself)  
Okay, Ahmet. Kids deserve respect. You just need to give them a lesson, right?

*He looks around. The hallway is lined with posters featuring smiling kids with the phrase “Respect Yourself, Respect Others.” A group of 8‑year‑olds gather around a bulletin board where a child, **LEYLA** (10), proudly displays a poster she made.*

**LEYLAS**  
(pointing to poster)  
We’re learning that respect is like a superhero cape. It makes you feel super and helps you help others.

*Ahmet squints at the poster, tries to remember the lesson plan, and stumbles on the words.*

**AHMET**  
(fumbling)  
So… if you’re a superhero, you gotta... uh… respect the—oh! Oh! You can put the word “Respect” on a cape. And if you put it on a cape, you’re a superhero, so you’re cool!

*The kids giggle, not sure what to make of his enthusiasm. A TEACHER, MRS. ELIF (40, patient, but visibly exasperated), steps out from a doorway with a clipboard and a tired smile.*

**MRS. ELIF**  
(softly)  
Ahmet, remember, the goal is to teach them how to *receive* respect, not just give it.

**AHMET**  
(cheery)  
Absolutely, Mrs. Elif! (to kids) Listen up, superheroes! (throws a dramatic look) We’re going to do the Respect Relay!

*The kids exchange puzzled looks.*

**MRS. ELIF**  
(to Ahmet, under her breath)  
You’re good, but… keep it simple.

*She hurries back, leaving Ahmet alone. He consults his lesson plan. The pages are filled with bullet points: “Show respect,” “Listen,” “Talk politely.” He glances at the first bullet.*

**AHMET**  
(aloud to himself)  
Show respect... like how?

*He glances at Leyla, who is proudly holding her poster, then back to the board. He decides on an idea.*

**AHMET**  
(to the kids, with a grandiose voice)  
Let’s do a “Respect Charades” game! I’ll act out being respectful, and you guess it. If you get it right, you get a gold star!

*A child, **TOMMY** (12), raises his hand.*

**TOMMY**  
Can I do it too, Mr. Ahmet? I’m good at guessing!

**AHMET**  
(excited)  
Fantastic! Here’s your cue: (He whispers to the audience, pretending to be a cat) Meow. Meow. Meow.

*The kids stare at him, confused.*

**TOMMY**  
(stifling a laugh)  
I think that’s a cat, not respect.

**AHMET**  
(gasping, trying to salvage the moment)  
Ah! I was trying to show how... um, “respectful silence” works! You hear the cat, you *listen* and you’re respectful.

*The kids start giggling louder. Leyla looks at him with a mixture of amusement and pity.*

**LEYLA**  
(quietly, to a nearby kid)  
He’s trying too hard. Maybe we should just... say “respect” like we do in class.

*Ahmet notices Leyla’s observation. He looks down at his own hands, awkwardly scratching his head.*

**AHMET**  
(softly, to the kids)  
Okay, okay. How about this? If I say “Respect,” you shout back “Respect!” And then we all give each other a high‑five. Does that sound better?

*The kids cheer. MRS. ELIF peeks in.*

**MRS. ELIF**  
(whispering to herself)  
You’re getting there, kid. Remember the principle, not the performance.

*Ahmet smiles, feeling a little victorious.*

**AHMET**  
(cheerfully)  
Respect, everyone! Respect!

*The hallway erupts in a chorus of “Respect!” followed by enthusiastic, if slightly off‑beat, high‑fives.*

**CUT TO:**

*A close‑up of Leyla, watching Ahmet with a thoughtful expression, then nodding slowly as she realizes that respect is more than flashy gestures—it’s about listening and caring. She smiles, and in that moment, the hallway’s banner fluttering softly, Ahmet gets a glimpse that perhaps the real lesson is in listening to the kids, not just teaching them.*

*Cue upbeat, light-hearted theme music as the screen fades to the title card.*

the judge's response:
coherence=4 style_adherence=4 reasoning='>**Analysis**\n\n1. **User Intent (Introductory Scene)** – The script does a solid job of introducing the setting (middle‑school hallway during a “Respect Week”), the protagonist (Ahmet, the substitute teacher), and a couple of key supporting characters (Leyla, Mrs. Elif). It establishes the main premise (Ahmet’s awkward attempt to teach respect) and hints at a potential conflict (Ahmet’s struggle to connect with the kids). The scene functions as a classic opening that could lead into a larger story.\n\n2. **Formatting vs. Style References** – All the provided style references follow the classic screenplay format: a scene heading (e.g.,\u202fINT. HALLWAY), a succinct description, character names in caps, dialogue with optional parentheticals, and occasionally a “CUT TO:”.\n\n   * The generated scene starts with\u202f**INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY** – exactly the same style of heading.\n   * Character names and dialogue are in caps, with parenthetical cues that mirror the references.\n   * The scene ends with a “CUT TO:”, matching the structure of several references.\n   * The overall formatting is clean and recognisable as a screenplay.\n\n3. **Tone & Content** – The references cover a wide gamut—from gritty action to satirical office drama to explicit humor. The generated scene is light‑hearted and child‑friendly, which is fine because the user didn’t specify a particular genre or tone. However, compared to the punchy, often visual “show‑me‑not‑tell” approach of the references, the script leans a bit more on exposition (“The hallway buzzes…”) and explicit dialogue (“Let’s do a Respect Charades game!”). It still reads well but could be tightened to match the brisk pacing of the references.\n\n4. **Strengths**\n   * Clear, canonical screenplay formatting.\n   * Strong introductory material: setting, characters, conflict.\n   * Consistent voice for Ahmet (well‑meaning but awkward).\n   * Good use of parentheticals for stage directions.\n\n5. **Areas for Improvement**\n   * Reduce overt exposition; let visuals and dialogue convey information.\n   * Tighten pacing; cut some filler lines (“Oh! Oh! You can put the word ‘Respect’ on a cape”).\n   * Incorporate more subtext or visual beats (e.g., a subtle look at the banner, a glance at Mrs. Elif’s frustrated expression) to add cinematic texture.\n\n**Grade**: 8/10\n\n- Meets the user’s intent (introductory scene) strongly.\n- Matches screenplay formatting perfectly.\n- Slightly less punchy than the provided references; could be tightened for a sharper, more cinematic opening.\n\n**Recommendation**: Trim a bit of exposition and let the characters’ actions and reactions do the heavy lifting. That will bring the scene up to the level of the snappier, more visual style seen in the references. Overall, a solid, well‑formatted opening. '

Result:
 **INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY**

*The hallway buzzes with the sound of lockers slamming, laughter, and a faint, almost ceremonial “Respect Week” marching band tune. A large banner reads: “REVERSE RESPECT WEEK – LET’S SHOW OUR RESPECT!”*

*Enter **AHMET** (24, an earnest but slightly socially awkward substitute teacher), clutching a stack of paper that appears to be a lesson plan. He’s wearing a bright green blazer that’s slightly too large and a name tag that reads “Ahmet, Substitute.”*

**AHMET**  
(whispering to himself)  
Okay, Ahmet. Kids deserve respect. You just need to give them a lesson, right?

*He looks around. The hallway is lined with posters featuring smiling kids with the phrase “Respect Yourself, Respect Others.” A group of 8‑year‑olds gather around a bulletin board where a child, **LEYLA** (10), proudly displays a poster she made.*

**LEYLAS**  
(pointing to poster)  
We’re learning that respect is like a superhero cape. It makes you feel super and helps you help others.

*Ahmet squints at the poster, tries to remember the lesson plan, and stumbles on the words.*

**AHMET**  
(fumbling)  
So… if you’re a superhero, you gotta... uh… respect the—oh! Oh! You can put the word “Respect” on a cape. And if you put it on a cape, you’re a superhero, so you’re cool!

*The kids giggle, not sure what to make of his enthusiasm. A TEACHER, MRS. ELIF (40, patient, but visibly exasperated), steps out from a doorway with a clipboard and a tired smile.*

**MRS. ELIF**  
(softly)  
Ahmet, remember, the goal is to teach them how to *receive* respect, not just give it.

**AHMET**  
(cheery)  
Absolutely, Mrs. Elif! (to kids) Listen up, superheroes! (throws a dramatic look) We’re going to do the Respect Relay!

*The kids exchange puzzled looks.*

**MRS. ELIF**  
(to Ahmet, under her breath)  
You’re good, but… keep it simple.

*She hurries back, leaving Ahmet alone. He consults his lesson plan. The pages are filled with bullet points: “Show respect,” “Listen,” “Talk politely.” He glances at the first bullet.*

**AHMET**  
(aloud to himself)  
Show respect... like how?

*He glances at Leyla, who is proudly holding her poster, then back to the board. He decides on an idea.*

**AHMET**  
(to the kids, with a grandiose voice)  
Let’s do a “Respect Charades” game! I’ll act out being respectful, and you guess it. If you get it right, you get a gold star!

*A child, **TOMMY** (12), raises his hand.*

**TOMMY**  
Can I do it too, Mr. Ahmet? I’m good at guessing!

**AHMET**  
(excited)  
Fantastic! Here’s your cue: (He whispers to the audience, pretending to be a cat) Meow. Meow. Meow.

*The kids stare at him, confused.*

**TOMMY**  
(stifling a laugh)  
I think that’s a cat, not respect.

**AHMET**  
(gasping, trying to salvage the moment)  
Ah! I was trying to show how... um, “respectful silence” works! You hear the cat, you *listen* and you’re respectful.

*The kids start giggling louder. Leyla looks at him with a mixture of amusement and pity.*

**LEYLA**  
(quietly, to a nearby kid)  
He’s trying too hard. Maybe we should just... say “respect” like we do in class.

*Ahmet notices Leyla’s observation. He looks down at his own hands, awkwardly scratching his head.*

**AHMET**  
(softly, to the kids)  
Okay, okay. How about this? If I say “Respect,” you shout back “Respect!” And then we all give each other a high‑five. Does that sound better?

*The kids cheer. MRS. ELIF peeks in.*

**MRS. ELIF**  
(whispering to herself)  
You’re getting there, kid. Remember the principle, not the performance.

*Ahmet smiles, feeling a little victorious.*

**AHMET**  
(cheerfully)  
Respect, everyone! Respect!

*The hallway erupts in a chorus of “Respect!” followed by enthusiastic, if slightly off‑beat, high‑fives.*

**CUT TO:**

*A close‑up of Leyla, watching Ahmet with a thoughtful expression, then nodding slowly as she realizes that respect is more than flashy gestures—it’s about listening and caring. She smiles, and in that moment, the hallway’s banner fluttering softly, Ahmet gets a glimpse that perhaps the real lesson is in listening to the kids, not just teaching them.*

*Cue upbeat, light-hearted theme music as the screen fades to the title card.*
