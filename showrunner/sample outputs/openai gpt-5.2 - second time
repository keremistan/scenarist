### INT. COMMUNITY CENTER – “ADULTING 101” CLASSROOM – MORNING

A cheerful banner hangs crookedly: **ADULTING 101: RESPECT, BOUNDARIES & BASIC EMAILS**.

A circle of folding chairs. A whiteboard reads:

1) Say what you need  
2) Don’t apologize for existing  
3) Use subject lines

AHMET (late 20s/early 30s), well-meaning but chronically unsure, hovers in the doorway clutching a notebook titled **HOW TO BE NORMAL (DRAFT 7)**.

He peeks inside like the room might yell at him.

The INSTRUCTOR, SELIN (30s, warm, efficient), spots him.

**SELIN**  
Ahmet? Come in. You’re early.

Ahmet steps in too fast, bumps the doorframe, then overcompensates with a polite half-bow.

**AHMET**  
Sorry. Sorry to the door. Sorry to you for the door. Sorry to myself for being born near doors.

Selin blinks, then smiles like she’s seen this exact flavor of panic before.

**SELIN**  
Great start. Take a seat—any seat you want.

Ahmet freezes. *Any seat* is too much power. He scans the chairs like they’re all booby-trapped.

He chooses one, sits, immediately stands.

**AHMET**  
Is this someone’s seat?

**SELIN**  
No.

**AHMET**  
Are you sure? Because I can also stand the whole class. I’ve stood through worse things. Like… childhood.

He laughs at his own joke a beat too long. Selin gently takes control.

**SELIN**  
Sit.

Ahmet sits instantly, like he’s been activated by a remote.

Two other attendees file in:

- **MERVE** (late 20s, confident, amused), coffee in hand.  
- **CEM** (30s, sarcastic, sleep-deprived), carrying a laptop like it’s his emotional support animal.

Merve notices Ahmet’s notebook.

**MERVE**  
“HOW TO BE NORMAL.” Bold. Is there a chapter on saying “no”?

Ahmet flips the notebook open reflexively—pages filled with bullet points, diagrams, and sad question marks.

**AHMET**  
Yes. But I wrote “no” in pencil in case it’s rude.

Cem snorts, sits, immediately opens his laptop like he’s about to file a complaint against life.

**CEM**  
This class better teach me how to send an email without it ending with, “Sorry if this email exists.”

Ahmet raises his hand like he’s in school.

**AHMET**  
I do that.

Selin claps once—bright, teacherly.

**SELIN**  
Okay! Welcome to Adulting 101. Today we’re starting with a skill most people never get taught properly: **respect.**

Ahmet nods too hard, like he’s trying to absorb it through his forehead.

**SELIN (CONT'D)**  
Respect for others… and respect for yourself.

At “yourself,” Ahmet’s smile wobbles.

**SELIN (CONT'D)**  
Because if you grew up in a place where your feelings were dismissed—

Ahmet raises his hand again, urgent.

**AHMET**  
My feelings were not dismissed.

Selin waits.

Ahmet corrects himself.

**AHMET (CONT'D)**  
They were… deported.

Merve chuckles. Cem looks up from his laptop.

**SELIN**  
A lot of adults struggle because, as kids, they weren’t taught they deserved basic respect. So they grow up thinking boundaries are… aggressive.

Ahmet raises his hand, very small.

**AHMET**  
I thought boundaries were something rich people have. Like boats.

Selin writes on the whiteboard: **BOUNDARIES = NOT RUDE.**

**SELIN**  
Let’s do a simple exercise. Ahmet—since you’re brave enough to speak—tell us something you need. Something small.

Ahmet’s eyes widen. He looks around, seeking permission from the walls.

**AHMET**  
Something I need?

**SELIN**  
Yes.

He thinks hard, like he’s trying to remember what humans require besides oxygen and apology.

**AHMET**  
I… need…  
(quietly)  
for people to not get angry when I talk.

Silence lands. Not awkward—just real.

Merve’s expression softens. Even Cem pauses typing.

Selin nods, gentle.

**SELIN**  
That’s not small. But it’s important. And you deserve that.

Ahmet squints.

**AHMET**  
Are you allowed to say that to a stranger?

**SELIN**  
Yes. Because it’s true.

Ahmet’s eyes water slightly—he panics, covers it with a laugh.

**AHMET**  
Okay, but if I cry, it’s not emotional. My eyes are just… social.

Cem leans in, deadpan.

**CEM**  
My eyes are unemployed.

Merve nudges Ahmet’s notebook.

**MERVE**  
Write it down: “I deserve respect.” In pen.

Ahmet recoils like she suggested arson.

**AHMET**  
In pen? That’s permanent. What if I change my mind later and decide I deserve… less?

Selin walks over, places a marker in his hand like a ceremonial sword.

**SELIN**  
Try it. Worst case, you learn something. Best case, you start acting like you matter.

He immediately underlines it three times.

Then—without looking up—

**AHMET**

Merve laughs. Cem shakes his head, but he’s smiling now.

Selin points to the board.

**SELIN**  
Lesson one: No.  
Lesson two: We’re going to practice saying what we mean—without fear.  
Lesson three: Nobody here is in trouble for having needs.

Ahmet exhales like he’s been holding his breath since childhood.

**AHMET**  
So… I’m not in trouble right now?

**SELIN**  
No.

Ahmet nods, relieved—then instinctively raises his hand.

**AHMET**  
Can I ask a question?

**SELIN**  
Yes.

**AHMET**  
Am I allowed to be relieved?

Selin smiles, heartfelt but playful.

**SELIN**  
Today? You’re required to be.

Ahmet tries to smile confidently. It comes out like a confused golden retriever.

**AHMET**  
Okay. I will do relief… respectfully.

Selin turns to the class, energized.

**SELIN**  
Alright. Let’s begin.

Ahmet grips his notebook like it might finally tell him the secret everyone else got at birth.
